# AI-Driven Natural Disaster Early Warning Platform

##  Project Overview
The **AI-Driven Natural Disaster Early Warning Platform** is a web-based application that provides **real-time weather insights and early warning signals** for natural disasters such as floods, cyclones, heatwaves, and extreme weather conditions.

The platform integrates **public weather APIs** and presents data through a **simple, responsive, and user-friendly interface**, helping users take timely preventive action.

## Key Features

 - Search Weather by City: Type in a city name to get current weather conditions.
 - Smart AI Risk Assessment: The backend uses AI trained on weather data and user messages to evaluate disaster risks.
 - Intelligent Warning System: When the system detects high-risk conditions, it automatically provides specific precautionary advice.
 - AI Learning Capability: The system learns from user inputs and interactions to improve its warning accuracy over time.
 - Clean & Fast Interface: Built with modern tools to be easy to use on any device.
 - Uses Real Data: Fetches live weather information from public APIs.

##  AI Training & Learning

Message-Based Training:---> The AI learns from user messages and inputs about weather conditions and disaster experiences
Continuous Improvement:--->  Each interaction helps the AI better understand risk patterns and appropriate responses

##🌍 AI Training & Learning – Disaster Risk Analysis

This project implements Message-Based Training and Continuous Learning for an AI-driven Natural Disaster Early Warning System using K-Means Clustering.

The system learns from user messages, weather inputs, and disaster experiences to identify risk patterns and improve alert accuracy over time.

📌 Objective

- Learn from user-submitted messages (weather conditions, disaster reports)
- Convert messages into numerical features
- Use K-Means clustering to identify disaster risk patterns
- Continuously improve predictions with new data

##  Risk Assessment & Warnings

Risk Level Evaluation: The AI analyzes weather data to determine risk levels (Low, Medium, High)
Context-Aware Precautions: When high risk is detected, the system provides specific safety precautions
Flood Risk: Evacuation routes, safe shelter locations
Cyclone Alert: Boarding windows, emergency supplies checklist
Heatwave Warning: Hydration tips, cool shelter information
